Reversi (Othello) is a 2 player abstract strategy board game. It is played on a board with 8 rows and 8 columns using a set of discs with one light (white) and one dark (black) side, each side belonging to a player. The goal is to have as many of the discs showing your color at the end of the game. More information can be found on Wikipedia http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reversi.

This Kata (see http://codingdojo.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?KataReversi) is to write a program that takes a current board position together with information about whose turn it is, and returns a list of the legal moves for that player. A move is only legal if it results in at least one of the opponent's counters being flipped.

Here is an example of input:

........
........
........
...BW...
...WB...
........
........
........
B

A "." indicates an empty square. A "B" indicates a black piece and a "W" represents a white piece. The trailing "B" indicates that it is black's turn.

You could either output the possible moves as co-ordinates (columns labelled A - H, rows labelled 1 - 8 starting from top left hand corner) like this: [C5, D6, E3, F4]

or graphically like this:

........
........
....0...
...BW0..
..0WB...
...0....
........
........
B
