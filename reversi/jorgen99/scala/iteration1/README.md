## Summary
This is the first iteration of my Reversi Kata in Scala. I'm doing this first iteration and at the same time reading "Programming in Scala", learning the language as I go. My plan is to do the Reversi kata more times and hopefully my code will improve.

I have tried to commit between writing a test, writing code that makes the test pass and refactorings. My idea was that someone going through the revisions could see my code grow, and hopefully come with some suggestions for improvement.
