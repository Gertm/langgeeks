## Summary
We started langgeeks to explore "obscure languages". Calling Scala obscure is probably bending the rules but it's on the place 43 on "TIOBE Programming Community Index for June 2010", right after Prolog at place 42, so I'll define it as obscure for now... :)

I've done most of my programming in Java over the years, but the last two years I have dabbled in Ruby and Python, both which I like very much. So I chose Scala, by some viewed as "The next Java", to see what the fuzz is all about.
